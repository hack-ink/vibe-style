# Documentation Governance

Purpose: Define how agent-facing documentation is organized, updated, and kept consistent
across this repository.

Audience: All documentation under `docs/` is written for AI agents and LLM workflows.
The split between `spec` and `guide` is by task shape, not by reader type.

## Principles

- Optimize for retrieval, routing, and execution.
- Keep one authoritative document per topic.
- Separate normative truth from procedural steps.
- Prefer explicit section labels and stable links over prose-heavy narrative.
- Let structure emerge from real topics. Avoid premature folder taxonomies.

## Document classes

| Class | Location | Answers | Source of truth for | Update trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spec | `docs/spec/` | What must be true? | Contracts, schemas, invariants, required behavior | Any behavior or schema change |
| Guide | `docs/guide/` | What should I do? | Runbooks, migrations, validation, troubleshooting | Any procedure or operational change |
| Plan | `docs/plans/` | What are we considering or executing right now? | Temporary plans and exploratory notes | As needed; may drift |

Supporting benchmark records may also live under `docs/benchmarks/` in this repository when a
plan needs a durable evidence artifact. These records are subordinate to one owning plan, are not
a fourth primary lane, and should use the plan-style header because they are execution records.

## Placement rules

- If a document defines correctness, it belongs in `docs/spec/`.
- If a document defines actions, it belongs in `docs/guide/`.
- If a document is temporary, exploratory, or expected to drift, it belongs in
  `docs/plans/`.
- If a dated benchmark note exists only to preserve execution evidence for a plan, it may live in
  `docs/benchmarks/` and should be linked from that owning plan instead of routed as a primary
  entrypoint.
- Do not duplicate the same authoritative content across documents. Link to the source
  of truth instead.
- A guide may summarize why a step exists, but normative statements still live in the
  governing spec.

## Document contracts

Every document should start with a short routing header.

Spec header:

- `Purpose`
- `Status: normative`
- `Read this when`
- `Not this document`
- `Defines`

Guide header:

- `Goal`
- `Read this when`
- `Inputs` or `Preconditions`
- `Depends on`
- `Outputs` or `Verification`

Plan header:

- `Goal`
- `Scope`
- `Assumptions`
- `Steps`
- `Status`

## Structure rules

- Prefer shallow paths by default.
- Add subfolders only when they mirror stable system boundaries or improve retrieval.
- Use descriptive `snake_case` file names.
- Do not require fixed filename prefixes unless a real ambiguity appears.
- Do not create empty folders, empty indexes, or placeholder documents to satisfy a
  taxonomy.

## Canonical entry points

- Unified documentation router: `docs/index.md`
- Normative router: `docs/spec/index.md`
- Procedural router: `docs/guide/index.md`
- Repo task and automation entrypoints: `Makefile.toml`

## LLM reading guidance

When answering a repository question:

1. Read `docs/index.md` for routing.
2. Route by question type:
   - "What must be true?" -> `docs/spec/index.md`
   - "What should I do?" -> `docs/guide/index.md`
3. Read `Makefile.toml` when the task depends on repository automation or named tasks.
4. Use `docs/plans/` only when the task explicitly concerns an in-flight plan or draft.

## Update workflow

- Behavior or schema change: update the relevant spec.
- Procedure change: update the relevant guide.
- If a change touches both truth and procedure, update both documents and keep their
  boundary explicit.
- When a guide starts carrying normative content, move that content into spec and link
  to it.
